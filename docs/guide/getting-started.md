# Getting Started

This guide walks you through your first private bridge using Pridge.

## Prerequisites

- **MetaMask** or compatible EVM wallet
- **Phantom** wallet (for claiming, or any Solana address)
- Assets on a supported EVM chain

## Step 1: Create a Private Deposit

1. Go to [pridge.io](https://pridge.io)
2. Click **"Create Private Deposit"**
3. A fresh disposable Solana address is generated

::: warning IMPORTANT
**Save your claim link immediately!** This is the only way to access your funds after bridging.
:::

## Step 2: Copy the Claim Link

The claim link looks like:

```
https://pridge.io/#3bkJCGFKYvkogDh3fjv8VLsCVmFn9ttSAvqLUCHfH6BW...
```

Store it securely:
- Password manager
- Encrypted notes
- Physical backup

Anyone with this link can claim the funds.

## Step 3: Connect MetaMask

1. Click **"Connect MetaMask"**
2. Approve the connection
3. Select your source chain from the dropdown

## Step 4: Bridge Your Assets

1. Enter the amount to bridge
2. Click **"Get Quote"** to see estimated receive amount
3. Review the fees
4. Click **"Bridge Now"**
5. Confirm the transaction in MetaMask

## Step 5: Wait for Confirmation

Cross-chain transfers typically take **1-5 minutes**. The page will automatically detect when funds arrive.

## Step 6: Claim Your Funds

Open the claim link (or share it with someone else):

1. Visit the claim link
2. Enter the destination Solana wallet address
3. Click **"Claim All"**

If the disposable has no SOL for fees:
- Connect Phantom wallet
- Your wallet pays the small fee (~0.00025 SOL)

## Done!

Your assets are now in the destination wallet with **no on-chain link** to your source wallet.

## Tips

- **Start small**: Test with a small amount first
- **Save the link**: Before bridging, not after
- **Don't reuse**: Each deposit should use a fresh disposable address
- **Privacy**: Don't claim to a wallet that's linked to your source
